# Bone Fracture Detection Using Deep Learning
## Problem Statement

Bone fractures are a common medical condition.Manual Detection Time-consuming, prone to error.Misdiagnosis can lead to delayed treatments and complications.AI-assisted detection can provide quicker and more accurate results. Assists radiologists in high-workload environments.CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) can effectively classify X-ray images as fractured or not.
